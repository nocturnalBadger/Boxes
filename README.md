# Boxes
Boxes is part physics demo, part sandbox game.

Something I made December-January 2014-2015. It started out when I was trying to learn my way around spritekit. Eventually, I found myself using intetrface builder to define constraints so it would work on all devices. 

Just tap the screen to make a box. Some of the values in the slider drawer apply only to newly created boxes while others (like gravity) affect the whole system. 

The size slider determines the range of the size. Any box created will be a random size within that range.

The value set on the friction slider determines the friction coefficient for newly created boxes. 

The bounciness (or restitution if you want to be fancy) is how much energy is lost from the box (or gained if you want to change the rules of physics) during a collision. It affects new boxes.

Gravity affects the whole world and updates live. Moving it all the way left will make gravity upside down.

Clear all buttin may be useful if you've created enough boxes to slow the game (congratulations!). 

Tap the color button to change the color of your next box (duh).
